This project contains a very simple script that can be used for fetching the SHA1 of the last commit from a chosen branch of a chosen repository. For now, only GitHub is supported, future version may introduce other web-hosting service support. Sample usage:

`php getsha maxmeister/getsha master`

The script has been tested only on Windows. Should you encounter any problems, please report them in the issue section of this repository.
